> I am a developer specialising in design systems, JavaScript, open-source and accessibility. I love solving problems at scale with systemisation, automation, modern technology and thoughtful design.

## Projects

### Australian Government Design System

As the Lead User Experience Engineer I worked in a team to launch the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au) to align 1000+ websites over 200+ organisations.

It was received as a [world class example](https://twitter.com/i/moments/970119499427938304) of what a Design System should be. It included accessibility guidance, rationales of design decisions and prominent contributors. 

We created and supported communities on [Discourse](http://community.digital.gov.au), [GitHub](https://github.com/govau/design-system-components) and Slack that drove the future direction of the design system.

We continuously maintained, created and enhanced the 25+ components. The components met WCAG AA 2.1 and best practice HTML, React, JavaScript, jQuery, CSS and SASS.

### Furnace

I led the development on [Furnace](https://designsystem.gov.au/download), a tool that removes the barrier to entry for users unfamiliar to _npm_ by allowing them to easily download a zip file of the design system.

Furnace is a NodeJS API that bundles component dependencies based on user input, outputting the result to a zip file. The development included building the user interface, server, continuous integration, continuous deployment, unit and integration tests.

### Chameleon

I mentored two developers, together we created [Chameleon](https://designsystem.gov.au/templates/home/customise/) a user interface and Node JS API that allows users to customise and share colour palettes of the Australian Government Design System.

The user interface of Chameleon allows users to choose colours and palettes. They can then view their selection with different types of vision impairment. As the user changes the colours the template renders again in real time.

When the user inputs a new palette it sends the values to a server. The values are then used to create a new HTML template that is sent back to the user interface.

### Harmonograph

As a child I used to visit the National Science and Technology Centre and see the harmonograph they had on display. A Harmonograph is a swinging platform where a pen attached to a pendulum, draws intricate shapes and patterns on paper.

Inspired I decided to make an npm package, [harmonograph](/harmonograph). The package draws a randomised harmonograph using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. The project was a perfect blend of code and design.

### A11yColor

Having to solve colour contrast for 1000+ websites I created functions to generate the nearest accessible colour in SASS and JavaScript. This allowed users to input their colours into a system and the output was guaranteed to meet colour contrast.

## Talks

### Names and culture

I gave a talk at Design System Meetup v4.0.0 about names and culture. I talked about how communication is hard and what we name things affects how well we communicate. 

Simple interactions like getting a haircut or ordering an ice cream can increase anxiety due to communication. Poor communication can change outcomes, how things are perceived and how they are used.

When building a design system we have to name a lot of things. Sometimes the names we give should be functional and understandable and other times there are opportunities to be creative and create a culture.

### Hard work to make it simple

I launched the Australian Government Design System with Trevor Brennan at Australia's first ever Design System Meetup. 

We talked about how we break down barriers between developers and designers by providing a common language for typography and spacing alignment. I also quickly explain our colour contrast system, built to help design meet AA contrast.

All of this at a scale suitable for a nation.
